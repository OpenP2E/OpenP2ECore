	 * The range increment of this ranged weapon (in meters, not feet).
	 *
	 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, page 279, "Range":
	 * "Ranged and thrown weapons have a range increment. Attacks with these weapons work normally up to that distance.
	 * Attack rolls beyond a weapon’s range increment take a –2 penalty for each additional multiple of that increment
	 * between you and the target. Attacks beyond the sixth range increment are impossible. For example, a shortbow
	 * takes no penalty against a target up to [18 meters] away, a –2 penalty against a target beyond [18 meters] but up
	 * to [36 meters] away, and a –4 penalty against a target beyond [36 meters] but up to [54 meters] away, and so on,
	 * up to [108 meters]."
	 *
	 * NOTE ON UNITS: The Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook uses imperial units (feet), but Unreal Engine uses metric units,
	 * so OpenPF2 does as well. To convert to the units used in OpenPF2, multiply the provided range (in feet) by a
	 * ratio of 1.5/5. For example, if a weapon has a range of 60 feet, then its range in OpenPF2 is:
	 * 60 feet * 1.5 meters/5 feet = 18 meters.

	 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, page 279, "Reload":
	 * "While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and
	 * reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if
	 * drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action.
	 * ...
	 * An item with an entry of “—” [-1 in OpenPF2] must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an Interact action
	 * just like drawing any other weapon. Reloading a ranged weapon and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free
	 * hand. Switching your grip to free a hand and then to place your hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon
	 * are both included in the actions you spend to reload a weapon."
	 *
	 * In OpenPF2:
	 *   - If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, they must be performed together as an activity.
	 *   - The special value of "-1" corresponds to the drawn ("—") value from the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook.

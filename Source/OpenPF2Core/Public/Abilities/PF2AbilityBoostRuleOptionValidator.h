/**
 * A service object for evaluating ability boost choices against ability boost rule options.
 *
 * For example, if a particular ancestry grants the player boosts to the following:
 * 1. Strength or Dexterity
 * 2. One free ability boost
 *
 * And the player chooses Intelligence and Strength, this class can determine that the boost to Strength goes with the
 * first rule option and the boost to Intelligence goes with the second rule option. Similarly, this class can be used
 * to determine what options to present to the player as they make choices, by eliminating options that are no longer
 * allowed by the combinations of rule options and the rule that the same ability cannot be boosted twice by the same
 * GA activation (for boosts granted "at the same time").

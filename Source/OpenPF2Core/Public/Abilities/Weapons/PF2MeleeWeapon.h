/**
 * Primary data class for weapons that a character can use to attack another character within reach.
 *
 * This is the top-most C++ base class for melee weapons, but there are several Blueprint sub-classes of this class that
 * offer functionality that tends to be a more complete fit for your own melee weapon implementations.
 *
 * (Though this is an abstract base class, it does not have the "Base" suffix in its name because the asset manager uses
 * the name of the first native parent class as the asset type).

	 * Play a montage and wait for it to end.
	 *
	 * Execution pins work as follows:
	 *	- OnEventReceived will fire if a gameplay event happens and either: the event matches EventTags or EventTags is
	 *    empty. The delegate will be supplied with the tag and event data.
	 *	- OnBlendOut will fire when the montage is blending out.
	 *	- OnCompleted will fire when the montage is completely done playing.
	 *	- OnInterrupted will fire if another montage overwrites this.
	 *	- OnCancelled is called if the ability or task is cancelled.
	 *
	 * @param OwningAbility
	 *	A reference to the ability instance that is triggering this task. (This is automatically populated by Blueprint
	 *	from the ability Blueprint.)
	 * @param TaskInstanceName
	 *	A custom name for this task, in case it needs to be queried later while it is running.
	 * @param MontageToPlay
	 *	The animation montage to play on the character.
	 * @param EventTags
	 *	A list of one or more tags that, if present in an event from the montage, will activate the EventReceived
	 *	callback. If empty, any event the ability receives during the montage will trigger the callback.
	 * @param Rate
	 *	The speed at which to play the montage, in case the montage should play faster or slower. This is a speed
	 *	multiplier, so 1.0f is normal speed.
	 * @param StartSection
	 *	Optionally, the name of the montage section from which to start playback.
	 * @param bStopWhenAbilityEnds
	 *	If true, the montage will be aborted if the ability ends normally. It is always stopped when the ability is
	 *	explicitly cancelled.
	 * @param AnimRootMotionTranslationScale
	 *	Amount to scale up root motion during montage playback. Set to 0 to block root motion entirely.

/**
 * An enumeration of the different outcomes from attempting a check or attack roll.
 *
 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, Chapter 9, page 445, "Step 3: Compare the Result to the DC":
 * "[...] if your result is equal to or greater than the DC, you succeed! If your roll anything less than the DC,
 * you fail."
 *
 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, Chapter 9, page 445, "Step 4: Determine the Degree of Success and Effect":
 * "Many times, it’s important to determine not only if you succeed or fail, but also how spectacularly you succeed or
 * fail. Exceptional results—either good or bad—can cause you to critically succeed at or critically fail a check.
 *
 * You critically succeed at a check when the check’s result meets or exceeds the DC by 10 or more. If the check is an
 * attack roll, this is sometimes called a critical hit. You can also critically fail a check. The rules for critical
 * failure—sometimes called a fumble—are the same as those for a critical success, but in the other direction: if you
 * fail a check by 10 or more, that’s a critical failure.
 *
 * If you rolled a 20 on the die (a “natural 20”), your result is one degree of success better than it would be by
 * numbers alone. If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”), your result is one degree worse."

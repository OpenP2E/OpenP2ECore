/**
 * MMC that calculates the "Spell Attack Roll" stat.
 *
 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, page 447:
 * "If you cast spells, you might be able to make a spell attack roll. These rolls are usually made when a spell makes
 * an attack against a creature’s AC."
 * ...
 * "Determine the spell attack roll with the following formula:
 * Spell attack roll result =
 * d20 roll + ability modifier used for spellcasting + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties"
 *
 * TODO: Figure out if we need to accommodate this, and how:
 * "If you have spells from multiple sources or traditions, you might use different ability modifiers for spell attack
 * rolls for these different sources of spells."

	 * "When every individual action counts, you enter the encounter mode of play. In this mode, time is divided into
	 * rounds, each of which is 6 seconds of time in the game world. Every round, each participant takes a turn in an
	 * established order. During your turn, you can use actions, and depending on the details of the encounter, you
	 * might have the opportunity to use reactions and free actions on your own turn and on others’ turns."

	 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, page 479, "Exploration Mode":
	 * "While encounters use rounds for combat, exploration is more free form. The GM determines the flow of time, as
	 * you could be traveling by horseback across craggy highlands, negotiating with merchants, or delving in a dungeon
	 * in search of danger and treasure. Exploration lacks the immediate danger of encounter mode, but it offers its own
	 * challenges."

	 * occurs when you are in the safety of a settlement, maybe recovering from your adventures or studying an artifact
	 * you found."

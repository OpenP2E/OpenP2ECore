	 * Collapses all of the values of a map to a single value by use of a transformation function.
	 *
	 * The transformation function receives a pair of values -- the "previous value" and the "current value". The
	 * transformation function is invoked once for each tuple of the original map. For the first value of the map,
	 * the "previous value" is the starting value supplied to this function, and the "current value" is the first tuple
	 * in the original map. For each subsequent call, the "previous value" is the result that was returned during the
	 * previous call of the transformation function.
	 *
	 * The original map is not modified.
	 *
	 * @tparam Key
	 *	The type of keys in the map. Must support hash codes.
	 * @tparam Value
	 *	The type of values in the map.
	 * @tparam Out
	 *	The type of result to return. (The type into which all input elements will be consolidated).
	 * @tparam Func
	 *	The type of the lambda function to invoke on each element of the input map, applying a transformation on the
	 *	element and the accumulated result to return a new output value.
	 *
	 * @param InputMap
	 *	The map of values to reduce.
	 * @param StartingValue
	 *	The value passed in to the Callable along side the first value of the map. If the map is empty, this will be the
	 *	value returned.
	 * @param Callable
	 *	The transformation function/lambda invoked to combine each element with the result of flattening/reducing the
	 *	previous element. This function is expected to take in the following two parameters and return a value that
	 *	matches the "Out" type:
	 *	  - PreviousValue: Which must match the "Out" type.
	 *	  - CurrentValue: Which is a pair of the "Key" and "Value" types.

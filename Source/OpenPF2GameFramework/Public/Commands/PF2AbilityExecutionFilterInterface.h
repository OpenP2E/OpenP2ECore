/**
 * An interface for classes that filter the execution of character abilities.
 *
 * Filters act like wrappers around ability invocation, affecting execution in one of three ways:
 *   1. Proceeding to activate the ability.
 *   2. Activating an alternate ability rather than the ability that would normally be invoked.
 *   3. Dropping execution of the ability all together.
 *
 * Any combination of the outcomes above can exist in the same filter, controlled by conditionals. Filters can also be
 * chained.
 *
 * Filters provide more flexibility than relying on tag-based blocking in abilities and gameplay effects alone, but they
 * are not intended to replace tag-based approaches. Rather, filters are useful when you need a straightforward way to
 * vary which gameplay ability gets executed by the same input action.

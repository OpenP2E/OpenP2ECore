/**
 * Type of object for instantiating sub-components for a character.

 * This is in a separate object to allow these types to be parameterized/templated so sub-classes can swap out the type
 * of each sub-component in their constructors. UE4 does not allow a sub-class to create a default sub-component having
 * the same name as one that was defined in the parent class.
 *
 * This approach is used as a workaround for a gap in UE4 constructor behavior. Prior to UE 4.23, it appears that the
 * standard pattern would have been to use ObjectInitializer.SetDefaultSubobjectClass() from within
 * UObject(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer), but that constructor was deprecated in 4.23. In UE5 it looks
 * like there is now a "Change Subobject Class" method through the "Subobject Data Subsystem".

 * The "processed" version of an PF2GameplayEffectContainer in which all effects are ready to apply to targets.

 * When an instance of this struct is created, CDOs for all gameplay effect types in the source GE container are loaded
 * and converted into gameplay effect specifications on the server. The resulting specs are then added to the instance
 * of this struct, enabling it to be passed around freely from client to server, from gameplay abilities into gameplay
 * effect executions.

	 * At the time that an instance of this container spec is created, this can be populated by target(s) provided at
	 * the time the GA was queued or executed by the player. For example, when a player is controlling a character and
	 * presses a button on the controller while the player has chosen another RPG character as a target, that target can
	 * be used to initialize this spec.
	 *
	 * Then, once this spec has been created but before it has been applied, additional targets can be added freely to
	 * capture additional targets that might be affected. For example, at the time that it is queued, an area-of-effect
	 * ability might only have a target location within the world but no target characters; then, at execution time, all
	 * targets within a certain radius of the target location would then be added as targets before this spec gets
	 * applied to its targets, applying the area of effect ability to all the matching targets.

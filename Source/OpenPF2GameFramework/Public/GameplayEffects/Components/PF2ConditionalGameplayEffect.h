/**
 * Struct for a Gameplay Effect (GE) that can be chained onto the application of another GE.
 *
 * This is modeled after the stock "FConditionalGameplayEffect" struct in the engine, but is more flexible. With this
 * implementation, game designers have greater control over when conditional GE are applied. Designers can specify:
 * 1. What tags the source MUST NOT have.
 * 2. What tags the TARGET MUST have.
 * 3. What tags the TARGET MUST NOT have.
 * 4. What tag query the source must satisfy.
 * 5. What tag query the target must satisfy.

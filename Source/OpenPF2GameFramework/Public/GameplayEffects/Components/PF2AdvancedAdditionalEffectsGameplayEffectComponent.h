/**
 * A Gameplay Effects (GE) component that specifies additional GEs that can be activated under certain conditions.
 *
 * This is modeled after the stock "Additional Effects Gameplay Effect Component" provided by the engine, but with
 * support for both: 1) tags that the source MUST NOT have and/or 2) a tag query for more complex business requirements.
 * In contrast, the stock component provides only the ability to specify tags that the source MUST have for a
 * conditional GE to be applied, whereas this component supports three different levels of requirements (required,
 * ignored, and tag query) that all must be satisfied for a conditional GE to apply.
 *
 * There is an additional difference between this component and the stock component. Since the stock component does not
 * support any tags being specified for "On Complete" GEs, this version of the component does not support "On Complete"
 * GEs at all, since it would not be improving on the original component; if you need "On Complete" GEs, use the stock
 * component for that instead. The two components are not mutually exclusive, so both components can be used in the same
 * GE.

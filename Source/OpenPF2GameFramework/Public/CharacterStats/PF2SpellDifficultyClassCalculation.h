 * MMC that calculates the "Spell DC" stat.

 * From the Pathfinder 2E Core Rulebook, page 448:
 * "Many times, instead of requiring you to make a spell attack roll, the spells you cast will require those within the
 * area or targeted by the spell to attempt a saving throw against your Spell DC to determine how the spell affects
 * them.
 *
 * Your spell DC is calculated using the following formula.
 * Spell DC =
 * 10 + ability modifier used for spellcasting + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties"

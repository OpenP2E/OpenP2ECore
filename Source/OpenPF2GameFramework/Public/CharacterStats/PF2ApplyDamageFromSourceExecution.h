/**
 * A gameplay effect execution to apply damage from a source onto damage targets, factoring in the target's resistances.
 *
 * The damage to be applied should be accumulated on the source in the form of values in transient attack attributes in
 * the "attack attribute set". Consider this example:
 *
 * - Character A is attacking Character B with an attack that does 5 fire damage and 3 cold damage.
 * - Character B has a +2 resistance to fire damage and a +1 resistance to cold damage.
 *
 * In this example, for Character A's attack attribute set, the "TmpDmgTypeEnergyFire" attribute would have a value of
 * 5 and the "TmpDmgTypeEnergyCold" attribute would have a value of 3. This execution would then read Character B's
 * resistances to fire and cold damage, calculate a total damage of (5-2) + (3-1) = 5, and then apply that damage to the
 * target's incoming damage transient attribute.

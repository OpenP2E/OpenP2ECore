/**
 * An execution calculation that should appear at the start of every weapon attack gameplay effect.
 *
 * This execution initializes the transient attack attribute set of the GE target with stats from the weapon that is
 * being used for an attack. This allows subsequent gameplay effects to be applied for bonuses and penalties (e.g.,
 * runes, magical spells, etc.) that affect the weapon stats before they're actually used to calculate the attack.
 *
 * Modifiers in the output of an execution can only affect attributes on the GE target, so this execution is designed to
 * be used only in a GE that is being applied to the SOURCE of an attack (i.e., the GE should be applied to the
 * character who is attacking, as part of the "Source Gameplay Effects" on the weapon).
